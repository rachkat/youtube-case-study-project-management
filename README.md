## 🧭 Executive Summary
This case study evaluates **YouTube (by Google)** through established **project management methodologies** (PMBOK) and agile practices. It reviews **scope, stakeholders, schedule, budget, risks, controls, communication, resource management, procurement,** and **project control techniques**, then offers actionable recommendations for improving delivery, governance, and collaboration.

**Highlights**
- **Scope:** Focus on creator tools, streaming performance, user safety/privacy; success criteria include engagement, upload efficiency, and ad revenue growth.
- **Stakeholders:** Creators, advertisers, Google dev/policy teams, and end users—with a structured stakeholder registry by influence/interest.
- **Schedule:** Agile sprints, Kanban, WBS; need stronger proactive planning and risk anticipation.
- **Budget:** Investments in creation tools, engagement features, and privacy compliance; watch for rework and specialized-talent bottlenecks.
- **Risks:** Copyright, user safety, scalability; mitigation via Content ID, AI + human moderation, Google Cloud elasticity.
- **Gaps & Recommendations:** Add **EVM (CPI/SPI)**, strengthen **cross-functional communication**, **resource planning (RACI)**, and **predictive analytics** to reduce rework and delays.
